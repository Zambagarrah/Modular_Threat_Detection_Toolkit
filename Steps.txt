Created a new Python file for the port scanner
    Imported some libs i.e

    1.  `socket`: Built-in networking library. It lets us connect to IPs and ports.

    2.  `argparse`: Makes our script usable from the command line with flags like --host and --ports.

Parse CLI Arguments

    Defined the CLI interface so users can run:

    This function parse_args() is part of a CLI prg. Instead of hardcoding values, it lets the user run the script with arguments eg. 

    `python scanner.py --host 192.168.1.10 --ports 20-80`

    **Purpose:** Collect user input (host and port range) from the command line.
    **Why:** Makes the script flexible and reusable — you can scan different hosts and port ranges without editing the code.

    **What it does:**

Creates an argument parser using Python’s argparse module.

Defines two required arguments: --host and --ports.

Returns the parsed arguments as an object, so the rest of the program can use them.
